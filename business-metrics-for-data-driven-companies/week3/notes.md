# Web Marketing 

### Web Marketing Metrics

These are revenue metrics, they lead directly to sales. They are dynamic, small changes (e.g. adword) results in rapid changes in these metrics. Marketing is the deliberate, measurable process of first creating and then continually increasing positive awareness and interest for a specific brand or service offered within a target demographic (group of people with common characteristics).

A business operating in a business environment with high switching cost probably does not have to provide outstanding products and/or service to be competitive. Imagine being the only pizza store in a small town where the nearest pizza store is over 80 km away.

Your message of difference is your market differentiation. Match your market differentiation with your target demographic. You often need to work with categories that have been predefined by others. These can help you find your target demographic as close as possible to your ideal target customers.

### Adwords

One of the most focused ways to reach people is by purchasing adwords, priced by auction by google. First, when a user enters search terms to google, google identifies ad words terms advertisers placed bids on.

Advertisers bid on keywords by settinga max cost per click through (max cpc) for each keyword they're interested in. Winning adword bids are sold for less than their maximum cpc. Most expensive adwords you can buy are "insurance" "attorney" and "mortgage". Google gets paid only when someone clicks through a sponsored link to the advertisers landing page.

Once you develop experience with adwords, you'll have experience on the cpc. Determine what % of people buy products at least once, this is your conversion rate. cpc/conversion rate = acquisition cost. 

### Segmentation

Want to identify common characteristics shared by visitors with high conversion to revenue rates, and high recurring revenue and lifetime value. When we segment our customers into groups and identify common characteristics so we can figure out what kind of visitors later become our best customers, we're engaged in sophisticated segmentation. Here are some good segmentation metrics:

1. Where do visitors come from? Sponsored serach, organic search, clicked clicked link, third-party website, etc

2. What devices were used to visit? Mobile (ios or android), mac or windows, browser, where in the world they are (ip address), are they new or returning? what happened at the site? bounce or had longer duration, how many pages visited? Basically track the clickstream 

Organic link - lower bounce rate
Sponsored link - higher bounce rate

You can do search engine optimization (SEO) to minimize bounce rate.

Basic SEO steps: Content is current, get third party website (quality and authoritative reputation), increase social signal (facebook, twitter)
