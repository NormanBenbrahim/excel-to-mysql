# Business Metrics

The best use of business analyst/data analyst's time is to find out what the best question to ask is, and find the best answer in the time available. You should ensure it has practical impact by translating it to a specific call to action communicated with decision makers using visual metaphors and non technical language. What can be changed right now to increase revenue, maximize profit, or reduce risks. The changes should happen either immediately and implementing it in real time, or as soon as possible. 

Things like sales tax is not a metric. However the percetage of people using an ad created by us to create clicks on our site, makes a "click-through" metric that is usable. 

All business metrics can be classified in 3 broad categories:

1. **Revenue**: This relates to sales and marketing. These are outward facing, they tell us something about how well or badly the company is selling and marketing its products. The company sales force will want to know how many units of each product was sold over a given time interval, and compare to different intervals. They may want to look at sales by region, product and new/repeat customers. They will want to know sales funnel; potential customers for future sales, where they are, etc. Meanwhile the marketing team will want to know how effective any marketing campaign is, how many people see our ads, what percentage responded, etc. **Everything related directly or indirectly to selling are revenue metrics**

2. **Profitability**: This relates to logistics and operations. These have to do with the efficiency of the processes by which the company delivers the goods. these are operational metrics, sought after people responsible for production, typically led by the chief operating officer. Anything relates to how much unsold inventory, how much production is unsellable (rotten mangoes), how often company is unable to meet requests due to insufficient production, how much spent on variable cost, etc. **Profitability is all about efficiency**

3. **Risk**: This relates to risk managers and creditors
