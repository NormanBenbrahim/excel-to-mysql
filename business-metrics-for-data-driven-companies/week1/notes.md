# Business Metrics

The best use of business analyst/data analyst's time is to find out what the best question to ask is, and find the best answer in the time available. You should ensure it has practical impact by translating it to a specific call to action communicated with decision makers using visual metaphors and non technical language. What can be changed right now to increase revenue, maximize profit, or reduce risks. The changes should happen either immediately and implementing it in real time, or as soon as possible. 

Things like sales tax is not a metric. However the percetage of people using an ad created by us to create clicks on our site, makes a "click-through" metric that is usable. 

All business metrics can be classified in 3 broad categories:

1. **Revenue:** This relates to sales and marketing. These are outward facing, they tell us something about how well or badly the company is selling and marketing its products. The company sales force will want to know how many units of each product was sold over a given time interval, and compare to different intervals. They may want to look at sales by region, product and new/repeat customers. They will want to know sales funnel; potential customers for future sales, where they are, etc. Meanwhile the marketing team will want to know how effective any marketing campaign is, how many people see our ads, what percentage responded, etc. **Everything related directly or indirectly to selling are revenue metrics**

2. **Profitability:** This relates to logistics and operations. These have to do with the efficiency of the processes by which the company delivers the goods. these are operational metrics, sought after people responsible for production, typically led by the chief operating officer. Anything relates to how much unsold inventory, how much production is unsellable (rotten mangoes), how often company is unable to meet requests due to insufficient production, how much spent on variable cost, etc. **Profitability is all about efficiency**

3. **Risk:** This relates to risk managers and creditors. This has to do with tracking and mitigating dangers. E.g. spending large portion of net cash flow on interest on a debt, a recession would cause this company to collapse. **Net cash out is always the most important metric to track**. How many months can it survive at the present burn rate? Another important metric for risk is churn rate. A company with a subscription based model that has high churn rate (rate at which new subscribers drop off within a year) runs the risk that over time there are fewer targets who have never been customers, and impossible to maintain revenue growth. Other examples of risk metrics involve financial risk. Risk is closely tied to debt.

# Traditional and Dynamic Metrics

Traditional include standard financial and managerial accounting categories such as quarterly statements of net cash flow, profits and losses and changes to balance sheet items, such as shareholders equity. These have their origins in paper and pencil after-the-fact reporting. These have their place, but we are going to look at more *urgent* metrics.

Dynamic business metrics can be communicated with urgency. What change in our business processes can we make RIGHT NOW to increase revenue, maximize profitibility or reduce risk. Two attributes make a business metric dynamic:

1. Significant change over a month or less. 

2. Are therer specific actions a company can take that visibly or significantly affect the metric in the short term.

Wether or not it is dynamic can also depend on the business context, for example say we have a 1000-store retail chain that is neither adding or closing stores, but is simply renewing leases on current spaces on prenegotiate terms for the leases. However let's imagine this store decides it will close 25% of its stores, and the real estate owner would have to find somebody who would pay for as much square footage as they do, or the real estate owner has to re-negotiate the terms of the lease. In this case the monthly cost for monthly rent per sq ft would be a dynamic business metric. This is why announcing all your bad news at once is often a good business strategy.

Dynamic metrics are twitchy. Small changes in process can have a big impact. e.g. the percentage of people who fulfill an online shopping cart and take the shopping cart to purchase is extremely sensitive to average page load time. Studies show pages that load in 3 or more seconds are much less likely to lead to sales. 40% will abandon that does not load in 3 seconds!

# Traditional Enterprise Sales Funnel

Recall revenue metrics are outward facing. They measure how well or badly the company is identifying new customers, communicating about its offers and value propositions to them and ultimately selling to them.

### Enterprise Sales

This refers to any sales that require full time sales people in your company. Enterprise sales refer to sales of complex equipment or services (a wind turbine, or a contract at a big office building for a contractor). Almost always involve sending you or your people to travel and do research. These are expensive, therefore the payoff must be large. A general rule based on the operating cost n the US, you want a minimum of 250000$ on a one time sale, or 100000$ on a recurring sale to justify and enterprise sales effort.

### Sales Funnel Metrics

Start with a lead, a person with contact you have that may lead to more business. Then qualify the lead (establish the target company wants to buy sufficient stock, and that they could afford to buy your stock). You need to identify the correct decision metric too. They need to be able to sign a purchase order. Great sales people are good at identifying the decision maker.

Once you do this that, you have a soft-circle sale. This is still a risky situation.

Enterprise Sales involve personal sales, and have embedded in them traditional sales metrics. At the other extreme, computer sales are impersonal. You don't typically meet with the people buying units on your website. Yet successful online retailers manage the customer experience so it doesn't feel robotic. 

# Inventory Management

Inventory management is one of the primary ways that operatiunbg companies can reduce cost and maximize profitability without lowering the quality of what they sell. Inventory is typically a finished product waiting to be bought on a shelf (or in a logistics warehouse). The more time it lies around, the less efficient for the manufacturer. Time spent in inventory erodes profits. 4 main reasons inventory time should be minimized:

1. **Negative float:** A manufacturer suplying a retailer typically doesnt get paid til the item is sold at retail, but the money is already gone. This negative float requires a capital therefore interest. Therefore if a company's interest is not good, it can go out of business.

2. **Fixed cost of storage:** Rent, guard, etc of a warehouse. The longer it sits there the more the cost of storage. 

3. **Wastage:** inventory items lose value the longer they are there. Some have value go to 0 if they don't get sold immediately, e.g. bread or fruits. Pretty much any item with regulation date.

4. **Obsolescence:** Items that stay for 6 months or more sometimes are no longer in demand by the sixth month (e.g. beepers, flip phones). Avg number of days inventory is held is a very useful business metric to track. This metric is also called *days inventory*

Not many companies are willing to make their days inventory metric public. However here's a handy trick for estimating it for publicly traded companies. Public annual reports include the value of inventory on hand at the end of the year, as well as the total annual cost of goods sold. Inventory on hand is valued using the same accounting methods as using the total annual cost of goods sold. So a very good estimate for average days inventory is:

avg days inventory = $365 \cdot \frac{\text{inventory on hand at the end of the year}}{\text{total annual cost of goods sold}}$
